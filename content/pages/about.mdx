## About Me

Hey, I'm Josh, a self-taught front-end developer based in Liverpool. My path into web development began while working as a production worker at an engineering company. Driven by a fascination with the web, I devoted my evenings to developing my coding skills through tutorials and hands-on projects. Over time, I developed proficiency in front-end technologies, particularly Next.js and Tailwind CSS.

Last year, I embarked on journey across Southeast Asia. During my travels, I established [BluButton Digital](https://www.blubuttondigital.co.uk/) to offer freelance web development services and continue advancing my skills.

Outside of coding, I have a passion for volleyball and I am a qualified coach and referee. This led to one of my notable projects, [Volleyscore](/volleyscore), a volleyball scoreboard app I designed and developed.
