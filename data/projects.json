    "markdown": "## Project Overview\n\nI am a coach and player for a local volleyball team. During training sessions and recreational tournaments, we all take turns to score the matches. We were counting the points using our hands, and we kept getting distracted and forgetting the score! I know this type of web app already exists, but I saw this as an opportunity to develop my own.\n\n### What was my main goal for this project?\nMy initial goal was to create a scoreboard web app allowing me to keep track of the matches. As I thought about the web app itself, many additional features came to mind that would enhance the user experience.\n\n### Current Features\n- Keep track of a best-of-5 set volleyball match.\n- Allows for timed matches.\n- Allows for single set matches with an unlimited scoreline.\n\n### Features to be added\n- [List upcoming features here]\n"
